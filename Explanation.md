In the code, the items are represented as associative arrays with keys such as 'name', 'category', and 'price'. The $filteredItems variable is an array that holds the filtered and sorted items.

Here's a brief explanation of the relevant array-related functions used in the code:

array_filter: This function is used to filter the items based on a given criteria. It accepts an array and a callback function that defines the filtering condition. It returns a new array containing the items that pass the filter.

usort: This function is used to sort the items in an array based on a custom comparison function. It accepts an array and a callback function that compares two items and determines their order. The array is sorted in-place.

Iterating over an array: The foreach loop is used to iterate over the items in an array. It allows you to access each item individually and perform operations on it.

The code example demonstrates how to load items from a data source (hardcoded array in this case), filter them based on a specific criteria, and sort them according to a given key and order. It then displays the resulting list of items using array manipulation and iteration.
